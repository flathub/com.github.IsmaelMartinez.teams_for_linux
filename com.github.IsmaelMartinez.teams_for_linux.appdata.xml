          Thanks to @standagh, @emanuelbatista, @jef79m and everybody that created issues/enhancements, fixed and/or tested them.

          Special thanks to @julian-alarcon for continuously supporting the snap version of this project and to anyone else that is supporting other package types.

          Thanks also to @byteSamurai for introducing hacktoverfest. I manage to get a t-shirt and to get a few people on my team to also contribute.

          Its been a long ride, and looks like Microsoft has heard us out loud, but until they got something working as stable as this, I will continue contributing.

    <release version="0.7.0" date="2019-08-19">
      <description>
        <p>Because #217, you need to clear you config folder before your 1st login (config folder locations). This is not necessary if you are moving from version 0.6.6 or higher.</p>
        <p>This release is been mostly concentrated on bug fixes and making this a bit more stable.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fix #220. Electron's getLocale, and Chromium's l10n_util, can return the language code in the IETF BCP 47 format (en-US) instead of the ISO 15897 format (en_US). Hunspell, the dictionaries included with this project, and the JavaScript code here assumes the ISO 15897 format, so this hotfix converts what getLocale returns. (#234) (97eb15f) Thanks to @pnickerson-cashstar</li>
          <li>Add flatpak to configuration directory list (#232) (afbb725) Thanks to @agates</li>

          <li>Fix #204. Updating default user agent string (#217) (952c55a) Thanks to @whofferbert</li>
          <li>Feature #185 Adding the ability to toogle fullscreen f11 (#216) (adeec1d) Thanks to @rt3norio</li>
